    <h1>The Learn Enough Story</h1>

    <p>
       Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach
       <em>technical sophistication</em>, the seemingly magical ability to take
       command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. This includes
       everything from command lines and coding to guessing keyboard shortcuts,
       Googling error messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing.
       We believe there are <strong>at least a billion people</strong> who
       can benefit from learning technical sophistication, probably more. To
       join our movement, sign up for our official email list now.

           HTML was created by the original "web developer", computer scientist
           <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim
           Berners-Lee</a>. It's not true that Sir Tim invented HTML in order to
           share pictures of his cat, but it would be cool if it were.

    <h3>Founders</h3>

    <p>
      Learn Enough to Be Dangerous was founded in 2015 by Michael Hartl, Lee
      Donahoe, and Nick Merwin. We believe that the kind of technical
      sophistication taught by the Learn Enough tutorials can benefit
      at least a billion people, and probably more.
